            <h1>Dive into Donut Delights</h1>
            <img src="media/boxofdonuts.JPG" alt="" width="250" class="rotate90">
            <p>When I was just 5 years old, donuts held a special place in my heart and memories. They were more than
                just a delicious treat; they were a source of joy and a means to make life a little easier. Every time
                my family and I would visit our local donut shop, I would be filled with excitement and anticipation.
                The colorful display of donuts behind the counter seemed like a magical world of sugary delights.

                During the holidays, donuts became even more significant. They brought my family together in a unique
                way, creating moments of warmth and togetherness. On special occasions, we would gather around the
                table, savoring the heavenly aroma of freshly baked donuts. Each of us would carefully choose our
                favorite flavors, and as we enjoyed these delectable treats, laughter and stories would fill the air.
                The simple act of sharing donuts created cherished memories that brought us closer as a family and made
                the holiday season even more joyful.

                Looking back, I realize that donuts played a small but meaningful role in my early years. They brought
                delight and sweetness to my young life, making everyday moments a little brighter. Those moments spent
                enjoying donuts with my family are now treasured memories that remind me of the importance of simple
                pleasures and the power they have to create lasting bonds.</p>

            <p>The Boston Kreme donut offers a delightful and indulgent experience for chocolate lovers. Topped with a
                rich
                chocolate glaze, this donut boasts a soft and squishy texture that is a delight to bite into. The
                chocolate
                flavor is apparent from the first bite, providing a satisfying balance of sweetness and cocoa. While the
                inconsistent size might be a drawback, the evenly cooked nature of the donut ensures a consistent taste
                and
                texture. It is worth noting that the Boston Kreme donut stands out among its counterparts as the least
                messy
                option, making it a convenient treat to enjoy on the go.
                <br><br>
                Despite its peculiar description, the Boston Kreme donut brings a unique charm to the Dunkin Donuts
                menu.
                With its unmistakable aroma of a freshly baked bread, it evokes a sense of comfort and nostalgia. The
                donut's decadent chocolate coma and sugary sweetness may be a bit overwhelming for some, but it
                undeniably
                satisfies those craving an intense chocolate fix. While it shares similarities with the Bavarian Kreme,
                the
                Boston Kreme manages to differentiate itself and impress with its chocolate-forward profile. Overall,
                the
                Boston Kreme donut offers a memorable experience for chocolate enthusiasts, combining a soft texture,
                prominent chocolate flavor, and convenient mess-free enjoyment.

            <h2 class="title">Bavarian Kreme</h2>
            <h3>Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;</h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                After tasting the Bavarian Kreme donut, I must admit that it left a lot to be desired. The donut
                resembled the Lemon donut in appearance, with a consistent size, but unfortunately, that was where the
                similarities ended. The sugar levels in the Bavarian Kreme were off the charts, making it excessively
                sweet and overpowering. The dandruff-like flaky sugar on top gave it a rather unappealing texture.
                <br><br>
                Upon taking a bite, the donut had a distinct smell of bread dough mixed with sugar, which wasn't
                particularly inviting. The weak custard filling inside was disappointing, lacking in flavor and
                consistency. It seemed to be inconsistently spread within the donut, resulting in some bites having
                hardly any custard at all. Overall, the Bavarian Kreme donut fell short, with its bland taste and
                lackluster custard, making it a sad excuse for a donut. The only redeeming factor was the sweetness from
                the sugar coating, but that alone wasn't enough to salvage this lackluster treat.

            <h2 class="title">Lemon</h2>
            <h3>Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</h3>
            <img src="media/lemon.JPG" alt="" width="250">
            <br>
            <p>
                The Lemon donut is a delightful treat that is coated in a generous layer of powdered sugar, creating an
                enticing visual appeal. As you take your first bite, you'll experience a snowstorm of sweetness that
                truly makes this donut a sugar lover's dream. While the shape may be slightly inconsistent, the soft
                bread is evenly cooked, offering a pleasant texture that complements the overall experience.
                <br><br>
                One aspect that could have been improved is the lemon scent, as it was not as pronounced as anticipated.
                However, once you indulge in the donut, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the burst of tangy lemony
                liquid that awaits inside. This delectable filling has a similar texture to maple syrup, adding a
                delightful contrast to the soft bread. Although the sugar taste might be overwhelming for some, it
                perfectly balances the tanginess of the lemon, creating a harmonious combination that keeps you coming
                back for more.
                <br><br>
                The Lemon donut truly shines. The avalanche of powdered sugar sets it apart visually, and the even
                cooking ensures a consistently enjoyable bite. While the scent may be underwhelming, the burst of lemony
                liquid within more than makes up for it. If you're a fan of tangy-sweet flavors and don't mind a sugary
                adventure, this Lemon donut is the perfect choice to satisfy your cravings.
